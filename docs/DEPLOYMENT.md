# Deployment and publishing

## GitHub source repository

Publish this directory as the repository root, not the outer workspace. `.gitignore` excludes dependencies, build output, Python caches, and `.env`. Never upload `work/`, the portable PostgreSQL data, credentials, or a real donor export.

After authenticating the GitHub CLI with your own account, from this directory:

```sh
git init -b main
git config user.name "YOUR NAME"
git config user.email "YOUR VERIFIED OR GITHUB NOREPLY EMAIL"
git add .
git commit -m "Build ShelterStock inventory and reservation prototype"
gh auth login
gh repo create shelterstock --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

Use your actual configured identity. A single honest initial commit is enough; don't fabricate backdated development history, adoption, or performance claims. The repository description can be: “Donation inventory prototype with PostgreSQL row locking, FastAPI, React, and concurrency tests.”

The included GitHub Actions workflow runs real PostgreSQL tests and builds the frontend. A green check is evidence from that run; don't claim it before it executes. Add a screenshot after running your own demo if helpful.

## Hosting later

Keep deployment provider-neutral: a Linux host capable of Docker Compose can run the current app; alternatively use a managed PostgreSQL instance and separate API/web containers. No provider account is required to understand or run the project locally. GitHub Pages alone cannot run this FastAPI/PostgreSQL backend.

Before exposing it beyond your own machine:

1. Add authentication and authorization to every mutation and relevant read. A volunteer ID in a request isn't proof of identity. For a private portfolio preview, gate the entire app and API behind an authenticated reverse proxy.
2. Replace local database credentials with secrets supplied at runtime. Use TLS for remote database connections, least-privilege roles, persistent storage, and verified backups/restores. Keep the database off public ports.
3. Build the images from this commit. Run `alembic upgrade head` once as a release step, before new API instances start. Do not run fictional seed automatically in a real environment.
4. Serve the frontend and `/api` under one HTTPS origin. Adjust nginx's upstream to the deployed API. Put a TLS reverse proxy in front; the current Compose HTTP bindings intentionally allow only localhost access.
5. Set request-size limits, rate limits, database connection limits, lock/statement timeouts, and operational logs without personal data. Decide how clients retry transient failures using the existing request key.
6. Run the PostgreSQL suite against a disposable `_test` database, then smoke-test reserve/cancel/fulfill against fictional staging data. Never point truncating test fixtures at application data.
7. For rollback, redeploy the previous compatible image. Back up before destructive migrations; don't blindly downgrade a live schema containing history.

Docker tags and direct dependencies are pinned for a repeatable starting point. Review security updates before deployment; this prototype does not assert that its pinned versions are production-hardened.

## Development without Docker

Use Python 3.12, Node 22+, and PostgreSQL 16. Create `shelterstock` and a separate `shelterstock_test` database. In `backend`, create a virtual environment, install `requirements.lock.txt`, set `DATABASE_URL` to a `postgresql+psycopg://` URL, run `alembic upgrade head`, then `python -m app.seed` and `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`. `requirements.txt` lists direct dependencies; `requirements.lock.txt` pins the full tested resolution used by Docker.

In `frontend`, run `npm ci` and `npm run dev`; Vite forwards `/api` to localhost:8000. `npm run build` checks TypeScript and emits production files. Windows sandbox environments may need `node node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js build --configLoader runner` to avoid restricted parent-directory traversal during config bundling.

For tests, set DATABASE_URL to the disposable `_test` database, migrate it, and run `pytest -q` from `backend`. The test suite truncates its application tables before each test; don't share that database with a running demo or another test worker.
