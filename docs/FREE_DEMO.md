# Free recruiter demo: Render + Neon

The hosted demo uses the real FastAPI application and PostgreSQL transactions.
One Render web service serves both the compiled React frontend and `/api`.
Neon holds the database. Local Docker Compose still works as before.

## Accounts and cost

Use only Render's Free web-service plan and Neon's Free database plan. Do not
upgrade or add paid resources. Free usage limits can suspend service; they do
not make this a production hosting arrangement. Check current terms at
[Render](https://render.com/docs/free) and [Neon](https://neon.com/pricing).
Render's free app sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity and can take about a
minute to wake. Open the demo shortly before a scheduled interview. Do not use
artificial keep-alive traffic. Render's free PostgreSQL expires after 30 days;
the instructions use Neon instead.

## Deploy

1. Create a Neon Free project for fictional ShelterStock demo data. Copy its
   direct PostgreSQL connection URL privately. Keep TLS enabled. Change the
   URL prefix from `postgresql://` to `postgresql+psycopg://`; preserve the
   username, password, host, database, and SSL query parameters.
2. In Render, create a Blueprint from this GitHub repository using `render.yaml`,
   or create one Free Docker web service with the repository root Dockerfile.
3. Set `DATABASE_URL` to the Neon URL as a secret environment variable. Never
   put the database connection string in GitHub or a screenshot.
4. Deploy. Startup applies migrations and seeds fictional data only if absent.
   `/health` is the readiness route. Render supplies the port and HTTPS URL.
5. Visit the HTTPS URL directly; no account or password is required. Verify
   reserve, cancel, and fulfill, then share the URL on your resume.

## Limits and operation

All visitors share the same fictional records. A cancelled reservation releases
stock; collected units stay collected. Add more fictional stock through Edit
before a later demonstration if necessary. Refresh to see another visitor's
updates. There is no destructive public reset endpoint.

`app/hosted.py` serves the public frontend and API and rejects cross-origin
browser writes. Anyone with the URL can edit the shared fictional records.
This is a portfolio sandbox, not individual volunteer accounts or production
authorization. Use only fictional data. HTTPS is required.

Test the hosted wrapper with the normal PostgreSQL pytest suite.
